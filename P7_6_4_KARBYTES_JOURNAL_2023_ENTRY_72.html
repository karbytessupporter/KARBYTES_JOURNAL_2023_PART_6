<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Last night on my way to work, I drove along Mission Boulevard after hanging out at California State University East Bay&#8217;s Hayward campus all the way down to Fremont and to see how feasible it would be for me to bicycle that entire way without having to take the BART train. It looks like it might take me up to two hours if I know where I am going (and I would learn fairly quickly but have to invest time getting lost (which can cost me several hours)). I honestly would rather reserve bicycling for recreation rather than for my main commute means. Anything short of driving seems barbarically antiquated to me. Fortunately, I read that used fully-electric (and not hybrid (which means powered by combusting gasoline and by an electric battery)) cars are within my reach to afford within two years if I build a savings account solely for that purpose. To save up $20,000 for a used electric car while earning approximately $600 per week, I could allocate $100 per week to my electric car pay-in-full savings goal and reach my goal roughly within two years.</span></p>
