<p><span style="background: #ffff00">I only got approximately $160 from my first paycheck because it is from the hours of the first week I officially stated working at Ontrac (which was last week on Thursday and Friday). Fortunately, I got some extra money today ($150) from my mom because it is my birthday today. I used that money to rent a motel room at the Motel 6 which is close to the west side of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altamont_Pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altamont Pass</a> in Livermore, California (and the price is very good and has not changed since I started using this motel more three years ago). This is the first time in what seems like two years that I have been able to go on an actual vacation. (Renting a motel room at the Motel 6 near the East Dublin BART station increased in price over the years to $120 per night while the other Motel 6 rooms seem to cost approximately $80 per night (and the room I am in has two queen sized beds, a mini refrigerator, and Wi-Fi which does not require a password (which is why I am using my AT&amp;T mobile data for &#8220;sensitive&#8221; activities and the motel Wi-Fi for less risky and more data intensive activities (though I find it useful to believe and not that farfetched to believe that &#8220;ethical hackers&#8221; are watching over my computer usage in order to prevent my intellectual property and accounts from tampered with by &#8220;non ethical hackers&#8221;)))). I took a photograph of my &#8220;miniature apartment rental experience&#8221; with my old Android phone which shows a lens flare in photographs I take with it due to the fact that I dropped the phone several times on accident and the front camera and back camera lenses are cracked. (I shared that image on Instagram but not on my other social media profiles).</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">I am enjoying this &#8220;out of the way&#8221; from where I usually hang out vacation in a private room where I do not expect to be intruded upon while living in here. There is a nice place to walk around outside later in the night when I expect to feel a hankering for some fresh air and moderate exercise. I am letting my nervous system calm down and enjoy not having to feel so &#8220;on guard&#8221; and bracing against the unpleasant environmental conditions (e.g. cold temperatures, humidity, wind, loud noises from cars and humans, the stench of pollution, and feeling exposed to the point that I am in a low level of constant emotional shock) as a consequence of almost always being in a non-private environment (especially in public outdoor settings). One of the main reasons why I am motivated to keep working for pay is so that I can afford to rent a motel room on the weekends when I do not have work. It is a low-risk investment (unlike renting an apartment) because the rental is short term (in time units of day/night cycles) and &#8220;low key&#8221; instead of more long term (in time units of months and years) with more eligibility requirements (e.g. credit score, income level, criminal background check, and probably social conformity metrics (which means that applicants can be excluded due to unconventional lifestyle choices unlike at most hotels)) and such an investment ensures that I have semi-regular respite from constantly being where other people are. Hence, part of my personal &#8220;religion&#8221; (or lifestyle trend) is living part of the time in motels (as often as I can comfortably afford) so that I get quality time alone at least once per week. (A part of me is complaining that I am not saving as much money as possible and that what I am doing is prioritizing short term gratification (i.e. renting a motel room once per week for at least one night but preferably two) over long term gratification (e.g. buying a used electric car) which means that I am, more or less, living &#8220;paycheck to paycheck&#8221; instead of accumulating a savings. Life is short and change can be abrupt, unexpected, and make saving money seem like an exercise in futility. Hence, I error on the side of being more &#8220;short term&#8221; than &#8220;long term&#8221; with respect to how I operate in a goal-oriented manner as an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #00ff00">As an aside, I have been reminded of prostitution a lot during the past few months. The past few times I traveled to Oakland (by car) to the shroomery to purchase cannabis to smoke and psilocybin mushrooms to eat, I saw prostitutes walking around near the shroomery (i.e. Zide Door) and I almost accidentally ran one of them over (which is another example of what I hate about driving a car which lacks robotic override which is supposed to prevent accidents which humans cannot due to humans having slow relatively slow reflexes and more blind spots than a 360 degree <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proprioceptive</a> system). Today I found a harrowing <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jan/18/i-was-sold-into-sexual-slavery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> about a young woman&#8217;s sex trafficking experience and escape (and she wrote a book about her experience). If I did not include this tidbit about sex trafficking, this web page looks superficially like a window into a relatively serene, affluent, privileged, sheltered, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wholesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;wholesome&#8221;</a>, and &#8220;<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(geeky)</a> white male oriented&#8221; worldview where subject matter focuses on science, technology, music, philosophy, aesthetics, and psychonautics instead of on what I think are horrifically degrading towards women and revealing of the unsavory aspects of human nature as expressed by &#8220;ancient&#8221; trends of exploiting, enslaving, abusing, and humiliating women for men&#8217;s egocentric desires.</span></p>
<p><span style="background: #009deb">One last thing: In my personal experience, customer service jobs (especially food service jobs) felt like public humiliation and human trafficking (like being treated like a &#8220;sitting duck&#8221; for random people to harass and exploit while the employee slavishly accommodates abusive customers in order to not be deprived of human decency which only money can seemingly afford). By contrast, working in a warehouse and not directly &#8220;on the front lines&#8221; where direct (in person) customer interaction occurs seems a lot more wholesome to me. Hence, I do it with relative gusto.<br /></span></p>
