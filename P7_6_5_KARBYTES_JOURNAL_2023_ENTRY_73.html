<p>I want to devote my life to helping to make psychedelics accessible to all persons, to switch from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources, and to establish a universal basic minimum income (the same fixed monetary amount (quantity of currency per quantity of time units) for each persons and an amount which maximizes each person&#8217;s wealth) where robots do the bulk of labor while humans are free to do whatever they want to within minimalist government rules which each person is subject to.</p>

<p>I remember some of the dreams I had during the past two years which were at least as meaningful to me and at least as vivid as my &#8220;waking life&#8221; experiences are.</p>
<p>I have the deep intuitive sense that I have been reincarnated many times and that I am part of an ongoing &#8220;inter-universal&#8221; hackathon, mission, or game in which I build the game or at least consent to entering it before I &#8220;lose myself&#8221; as a playable character in that game forgetting how I set up my virtual reality and then acquired strategic amnesia about how perfectly all the components align to suit what seems to be a story written for me by my predecessors and then innately programmed into my human character.</p>
<p>I remember being high on approximately 7 grams of shrooms in June 2022 and experiencing a &#8220;conclusion&#8221; that a goal ceases to be satisfying once the information processing agent attains that goal state. In order to not die due to apathy, I need to constantly have goals to strive for in order to compel my body (and my cells) to stay alive.</p>
<p>I am afraid that progress attained is lost and perhaps forgotten and perhaps never to occur again.</p>
<p>Entropy seems to be the most essential threat to my sense of autonomy and security of valued possessions.</p>
<p>I hope to not lose my karbytes &#8220;soul&#8221; which seems to have been originated in this lifetime and not in some prior lifetime. It is possible that this lifetime will be lived again by me in the future. I would not know it because each experience of this life would feel like the first and the lastI remember some of the dreams I had during the past two years which were at least as meaningful to me and at least as vivid as my &#8220;waking life&#8221; experiences are.</p>
